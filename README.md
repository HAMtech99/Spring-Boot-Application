# Spring Boot Form Handling Application

This is a simple **Spring Boot web application** that demonstrates how to build a form, handle user input, and render results dynamically with **Thymeleaf templates**.  

The project was generated with **Spring Initializr**, written in **Java**, and packaged using **Maven**. This application remains under continued development and will soon be containerized and deployed to AWS.
